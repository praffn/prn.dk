import Playground from "playground";

## Hello, there. This is some code

```
Barebones thing
```

To build this component, I forked agneym's Playground. It's a fantastic little utility. I did make some pretty substantial tweaks, mostly to the cosmetics and usability (the underlying rendering logic is mostly unchanged).

<Playground
  initialSnippet={{
    markup: `<div class="wrapper">
  <h2>Hello World</h2>
</div>
`,
    javascript: ``,
    css: `.wrapper {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
\n\
body {
  height: 100vh;
  background: silver;
}
`,
  }}
/>

```js
function double(x) {
  return x * 2;
}

double(42);
```

```ts
interface Foo {
    x: boolean;
}

function makeFoo(): Foo {
    return {
        x: Math.random() > 0.5;
    }
}
```
